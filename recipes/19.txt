Ingredients

    2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1 teaspoon salt
    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
    1 1/2 cups brown sugar
    1/2 cup sugar
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    2 cups (12-ounce package) chocolate chips

Directions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking sheets or spray cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray.

Put the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl and stir it with a whisk to combine. Set aside.

Using a hand or stand mixer, beat the butter until it is lighter in color. Slowly add in sugars and beat until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time and beat until they are incorporated. Stir in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture using low speed, then stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are lightly browned around the edges, about 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes and then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.
