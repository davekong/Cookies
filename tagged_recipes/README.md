Tags are indicated by an underscore following a word. Words may have the following tags:

	q: Quantity
	u: Unit
	f: Food. For example, "flour," "baking soda" or "chocolate chips"
	m: Modifier (of food). For example, "all purpose" or "whole-wheat"
	d: Degrees (temperature)
	t: Cooking time

For example, you would tag this line:
> 2 cups sifted flour
as
> 2_q cups_u sifted_m flour_f

This indicates that the ingredient quantity is 1, the unit is "cups", the food is "flour" and it is modified by the adjective "sifted".
