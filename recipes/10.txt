Cooking Procedure

    Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
    In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, and baking soda. Mix well and set aside.
    On a separate mixing bowl, put in butter and beat. Gradually add both sugars while beating.
    Add-in the vanilla extract and eggs (one piece at a time) while beating.
    Gradually add the flour, salt, and baking soda mixture and beat until all the ingredients are well mixed.
    Put-in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts. Fold until the chips and nuts are well incorporated.
    Arrange parchment paper in a baking sheet. Scoop and drop the mixture on the parchment paper. Note: try to press the mixture a little bit to make the cookie flat. This will also give you room if you want to place extra chocolate chips on top of the cookie.
    Place inside the oven and bake for 7 to 9 minutes.
    Remove from the oven and place in cooling racks.
    Serve. Share and enjoy!
